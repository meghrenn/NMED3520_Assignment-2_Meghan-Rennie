                <p class="megh-writes">To whom it may concern:</p>
                <p class="megh-writes"> I am terrible at responding to messages. Texts, emails, DMs, voicemails...it
                    doesn't
                    matter. I ignore them all. </p>
                <p class="megh-writes">I am more of a phantom than a friend, constantly ghosting my loved ones. On my
                    phone,
                    my notifications serve as headstones, marking conversations’ tragic demises. Meanwhile, my inbox is
                    a
                    casket, its contents embalmed and unread, preserving proof of my impudence. People get more
                    consistent
                    conversation from spirits, speaking via Ouija boards. </p>
                <p class="megh-writes">Of course, you already know this. By virtue of visiting this site, you must,
                    yourself, be a victim of my terrible messaging etiquette. I bet that I’ve apologized for it, before.
                    I
                    also bet that, after
                    smoothing things over between us, I’ve promptly re-offended.</p>
                <p class="megh-writes">Sorry about that.</p>
                <p class="megh-writes">Generally, sincere apologies are accompanied by actual changes in behaviour. I
                    swear,
                    I am trying to be more responsive! As cheesy as it sounds, It’s not you, it’s me. My absence is not
                    reflective of my feelings. I care about you and our relationship. I am fighting to overcome my bad
                    habits. </p>
                <p class="megh-writes">There are <a href="excuses.html">a lot of reasons</a> that I'm not responding to
                    my
                    messages; some of them are more valid than others. Ultimately, though, I believe it comes down
                    to this: Most people have a Pavlovian prompting set deep in their heads, which pulls them to
                    their phone as soon as it pings. For some reason, that particular leash never latched onto my
                    collar.
                    Its attempts to pull me cause it to slip right through, like a spaghetti noodle through the tines of
                    a
                    fork. I just can’t bring myself to respond.</p>
                <p class="megh-writes">I want you to understand that I am not snubbing you intentionally. I sincerely
                    apologise for my behaviour, whilst acknowledging that I am serially guilty of re-offending. I hope
                    this
                    website can offer a deeper understanding of my perspective, or at least <a
                        href="distractions.html">entertain and distract</a> you while
                    you wait for me to one day, finally, message back. </p>
                <p class="megh-writes">Sincerely,</p>
                <p class="megh-writes">Meghan</p>
